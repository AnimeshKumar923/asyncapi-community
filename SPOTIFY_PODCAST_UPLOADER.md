#### This document covers the steps to upload a YouTube video/livestream from AsyncAPI YouTube Channel.

## FAQ

### Why do we need this feature?

- There are some people who favor listening the video/livestream as an audio (podcast) instead of watching the video.

- The goal is to upload our AsyncAPI video/livestreams on `Spotify For Podcasters` platform which will ultimately allow the listener to play the episodes on Spotify. Almost every YouTube video can be converted into a podcast.

- This workflow provides the solution to the above problem.

### Who can upload the videos?

- The workflow can only be triggered by a person who has the write-access to the `master` branch of `asyncapi/community` repository.

### What is needed?

- The YouTube video ID is needed to trigger the workflow.
